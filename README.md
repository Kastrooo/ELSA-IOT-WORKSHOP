## **üõ†Ô∏è Experiments and Projects**

Here‚Äôs a list of some of the experiments included in this repository:

#### **1. Sensor-Based Experiments**
- **IR Sensor**: Detect motion or obstacles using an IR sensor.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measure distance with an ultrasonic sensor.
- **DHT Sensor**: Read temperature and humidity using DHT11.

#### **2. Actuator Control**
- **Servo Motor**: Control servo motor positions using a slider or predefined angles.
- **LCD Display**: Display text on an I2C LCD (16x2).

#### **3. IoT-Based Projects**
- **Blynk Integration**: 
  - Remote servo control and sensor data monitoring.
  - Real-time LED switching and data visualization.
- **RemoteXY**:
  - Build custom mobile apps for controlling ESP32 functionalities.
  - Examples include servo control and LED toggling.

#### **4. Combined Projects**
- **Multi-Sensor Dashboard**: Monitor multiple sensors (ultrasonic and DHT) and control actuators via a single interface like Blynk or RemoteXY.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-arduino-projects.git
   ```
2. **Open in Arduino IDE**:
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Add ESP32 boards to the IDE. Instructions [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html).

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Use the Arduino IDE Library Manager to install dependencies like `DHT`, `Servo`, `Blynk`, and `LiquidCrystal_I2C`.

4. **Upload to ESP32**:
   - Connect your ESP32 to your PC via USB.
   - Select the correct board (ESP32 Wrover Module) and port in Arduino IDE.
   - Upload the desired sketch.
